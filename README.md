The report explores the PISA 2012 dataset that can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisa2012.csv.zip&sa=D&ust=1551376898573000). Since the PISA 2012 dataset is a complex huge dataset, this report is going to focus on specific variables related to the evaluation of the mathematics level of students in three countries: Finland, United Arab Emirates, and Unites States of America.

An explanation of the variables used:

COUNTRY: 3 countries (Finland, United Arab Emirates, United States of America)
GENDER: 2 genders (Female, Male)
ENJMATH: answers to "Do you (the student) enjoy mathematics?" 4 answers (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Agree, Strongly agree)
PARENJMATH: answers to "Do your parents (the student's parents) enjoy mathematics?" 4 answers (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Agree, Strongly agree)
WEALTH: a float that is calculated by number of questions in the PISA 2012 dataset to measure wealth of the family of the student
TEACHERCLASSMANAG: a float that is calculated by number of questions in the PISA 2012 dataset to measure class management by the teacher
COGNITIVEACTIV: a float that is calculated by number of questions in the PISA 2012 dataset to measure the cognitive activation of mathematics by the student
TEACHSTUDRELAT: a float that is calculated by number of questions in the PISA 2012 dataset to measure the relationship between the teacher and the student
PV1MATH, PV2MATH, PV3MATH, PV4MATH, PV5MATH: 5 plausible values to the mathematical literacy of the students
